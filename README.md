## Installation

To install the stable version:

```
npm install fp-ts fp-ts-pool
```

`fp-ts` is a peer dependency. Make sure to always have a single version of `fp-ts` installed in your project. Multiple versions are known to cause `tsc` to hang during compilation. You can check the versions currently installed using `npm ls fp-ts` (make sure there's a single version and all the others are marked as `deduped`).
